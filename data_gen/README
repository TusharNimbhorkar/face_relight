In relight_data_synth.py change the path of the source normal files (root) and the output path (dst_root).
Do not change any parameter of relight() except foor relight_name, which relates to the script that will be executed in blender. There are 3 choices as of now and of course more can be added:
    - relight.py - for generating a relight dataset (currently set for ambient dataset - in the spirit of v0.3.1)
    - relight_ambient_color.py - for generating an ambient color dataset (v0.5.2)
    - relight_shading_map.py - for generating shading maps (v0.9.0)

In the selected file  you should change what parameters to be saved and what should not be according to your needs.
All parameters that vary should be saved, parameters that are constant can be saved or not.
Make sure to keep the title line correct - there are restrictions on what exact names can be used in the title, since the name of a parameter identifies it in gen_sh
All line should be comma separated. In all non-title lines no spaces are allowed (except if part of a string).

To start generating, run:
python relight_data_synth.py
